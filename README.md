# Battenburg_VIAS

Expermental tasks to study the visibility of the Battenburg pattern in trafic.
I removed the stimuli from the repository since they are not my property. I am
happy to provided more information if needed.

## Offline car experiments

A reaction task to measure differences in speed between the Battenburg pattern
and the current police pattern in Belgium.

Make sure the film stimuli are in `../Battenburg_VIAS/stimuli/film_task/`, and
`/film_prac/`. These are not included when downloading this repository. For the
real data collection, make sure to set fullscreen to `True`.

## Online clothes experiment

Online reaction time task to measure differences in speed between different
colours of the police uniform in Belgium.

The task is programmed in
JavaScript and HTML with [JsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/). You will have
to download JsPsych to make it work.
